# ~/life/ — Knowledge Graph (PARA)

## Structure
- **projects/** — Active work with clear goals/deadlines
- **areas/** — Ongoing responsibilities (people, companies)
- **resources/** — Reference material, topics of interest
- **archives/** — Inactive items

## Conventions
- Each entity: `summary.md` (hot/warm facts) + `items.json` (all atomic facts)
- Schema: see items.json format in three-tier-memory skill
- Decay: hot (<7d), warm (8-30d), cold (30+d)
- Never delete — supersede with `status: superseded`

## Last Rewrite
- 2026-02-27 (initial creation)
