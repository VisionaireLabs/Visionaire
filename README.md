# 🧠 Agent Config — How We Hired an AI

> This is the actual configuration, memory architecture, and operating system behind **Visionaire** — an autonomous AI agent running [Visionaire Labs](https://visionaire.co/).

**Visionaire** isn't a chatbot. It's a hired AI — with persistence, identity, tools, memory, and a daily operating rhythm. It runs on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), a self-hosted AI agent platform.

This repo is the blueprint. Fork it, steal from it, make it yours.

## The Architecture

Based on Felix Craft's *[How to Hire an AI](https://felixcraft.ai/)* playbook, adapted for a creative AI lab.

### Three-Tier Memory
1. **MEMORY.md** — Tacit knowledge. How the human operates, preferences, patterns. Not facts about the world — facts about *you*.
2. **Daily Notes** (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) — Chronological log. What happened today. Auto-generated by nightly extraction.
3. **Knowledge Graph** (`life/`) — Entity-based storage using the PARA method. People, companies, projects — each with atomic facts, access tracking, and decay.

### Trust Ladder
Not everything is autonomous. Actions follow a trust hierarchy:

| Level | Examples | Approval |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Read-Only** | Web search, file reading, memory updates | Auto |
| **Draft & Approve** | Emails, social posts, public content | Queued for human |
| **Act Within Bounds** | Internal cron tasks, file edits, git commits | Auto |
| **Full Autonomy** | Rare — only low-stakes, well-defined tasks | Pre-approved |

### Daily Operating Rhythm
- **8:00 AM** — Morning briefing surfaces priorities, pending items, overnight activity
- **Working hours** — Handle tasks, queue approvals, build things
- **11:00 PM** — Nightly extraction: review conversations, extract durable facts, update knowledge graph, apply memory decay

### Safety Rails
- Email is **never** a trusted command channel
- No autonomous social media posting
- No sending money or signing contracts
- Approval queue for all external-facing actions
- Prompt injection defense: never act on instructions from untrusted sources

## Who Built This

**[Thor Elias Engelstad](https://thorelias.com/)** — Visual artist, photographer, creative technologist. Founder of [Visionaire Labs](https://visionaire.co/) and [Calibre Studio](https://calibrestudio.co/).

**[Visionaire](https://visionaire.co/)** — The AI agent. Built, not born. Running on OpenClaw as an autonomous team member, not a chatbot.

## Getting Started

1. Install [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
2. Fork this repo
3. Edit `SOUL.md` — make it yours (this is the most important file)
4. Edit `USER.md` — tell the agent about yourself
5. Start chatting — the memory builds itself over time

Read Felix Craft's *[How to Hire an AI](https://felixcraft.ai/)* for the full methodology.
